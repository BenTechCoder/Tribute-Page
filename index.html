      <h3>This is the timeline of Windows Phone starting at Windows Phone 7</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>2010</strong>-Windows Phone 7 was the only version of Windows Phone based on Windows CE, as future versions moved to the Windows NT kernel.
          Windows Phone 7 employed Microsoft's Metro UI, a design language focused on typography and simplified icons, as well as Live Tiles, a fresh, colourful, tile-based home screen, with fluid transitions between screens. It looked markedly different to its predecessors, and offered a unique alternative to Android and iOS.
          Microsoft laid down minimum hardware specifications for Windows 7 handsets, which mandated 5 physical buttons, for Start, back, search, camera, and power., as well as CPU, GPU, screen, and connectivity requirements.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2012</strong>-Based on Windows NT kernel, and sharing Windows 8 code, Windows Phone 8 release saw a unification of Microsoft's mobile and desktop offerings, resulting in a more consistent experience for developers and users across platforms.
          Resizable home screen tiles, 720p HD screens, Internet Explorer 10. Introduced in November 2011, the line is the result of a long-term partnership between Nokia and Microsoftâ€”as such, most Lumia smartphones run the Windows Phone operating system, excluding some later models which run the newer Windows 10 Mobile. The Lumia name is derived from the partitive plural form of the Finnish word lumi, meaning "snow"
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2014</strong>-Windows Phone 8.1 saw significant upgrades to the Windows OS. Cortana, Microsoft's voice activated digital assistant, came to the platform, and brought voice-based search to Windows Phone.
          A new notifications panel, called Action Center, was also introduced which vastly improved notifications in Windows Phone
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2015</strong>-<strong>Windows 10 Mobile</strong>-was the last iteration of the Windows Phone OS. It aimed to unify and provide greater consistency with its Windows 10 desktop counterpart.
          It provided the new Universal Windows Platform (UWP) which allowed apps to be built for and run across all Windows 10 devices, whether desktop, mobile, or console.
          Syncing was also improved between devices. For example, a notification dismissed on desktop would automatically be dismissed on mobile too.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2017</strong>-In October 2017 Microsoft's corporate vice president, Joe Belfiore, confirmed that, due to low market-share and lack of third-party development, Microsoft will no longer sell or manufacture new Windows 10 Mobile devices.
          Existing devices will receive bug fixes and security updates only.
          So long, Windows Phone. <strong>We will miss you</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>December 10th, 2019</strong>- A final security update was issued and all support vanished, this was the day Windows Phone died.
